This directory contains all of our aggregated results from existing papers and our code to analyze them. To reproduce all of our figures and statistics, run:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python python/main.py
```
You can find the spreadsheets of papers and results in [this airtable](https://airtable.com/shreGTLuvrXuWxs19) or as csv files under the `assets/` directory. You can find a slightly more up-to-date version (which is directly open to edits/additions) [here](https://airtable.com/tblEsJTNxoSFkMofU/viwvSaAk7rOli5I6q).
